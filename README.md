# lashora-tryon# Lashora Virtual Lash Try-On â€“ Developer README

## Project Goal

Create a luxury-themed virtual lash try-on experience for Lashora, inspired by Lashifyâ€™s platform. The app will use real-time webcam input with MediaPipe FaceMesh to overlay 13 lash styles on the userâ€™s eyes. It must be mobile responsive, fast, and feel like a premium cosmetic tech product. Final integration will embed into Shopify via iframe.

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite
- MediaPipe FaceMesh
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel (frontend deployment)
- GitHub (daily commits required)

## Project Structure

## Mobile UI Layout Reference

This project must closely replicate the mobile user interface of Lashify's Virtual Try-On, including:

- Top camera overlay with clear "Virtual Try-On" title
- Interactive lash adjustment panel:
  - **Lash Map** selector
  - **Color** dropdown (e.g. Black)
  - **Length** adjuster (e.g. Medium + / -)
  - **Style** carousel (e.g. AMPLIFY, Luna Line, etc.)
- **Add to Bag** button (prominent and centered)
- **"Select Individual Lengths"** secondary CTA (can be excluded in MVP if not needed)
- Floating icons:
  - Zoom
  - Hide lashes
  - Fullscreen toggle
- Must be touch-friendly, buttery smooth, and responsive on iPhone and Android.
